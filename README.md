# Cosy-ligra

This repository is a fork of Jana's [Ligra](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra), documenting my Ligra build. This variant of Ligra is optimised for my specific set of tools, current interests, and locally available fasteners, rather than for broad reproducibility. 

"Cosy-ligra" uses only two extrusions, purely for aesthetics (and because I had 2 of the perfect length already..), and as such isn't really rugged enough for outdoor use. I will be using it for indoor art projection mostly.
