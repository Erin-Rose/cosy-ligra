## Preface

This guide assumes that you are building the same ligra as I did, I will try to make it clear, when something is either optional or specific to my hardware/your hardware. All in all I want to show you, how you can design your own projector, Gobo, light-graffiti, art-, whatever-light-machine. I want to show you, how you can bring a lens, a light source and something image forming together to crate something that allows you to be creative.

## Planning

Given that this is rather an instruction on how to design and build various projectors instead of a speicific one, you should think about which tools you have at your disposal, what your targeted usecase may be and what materials you have and can work with. Before starting, read all the instructions and plan your ligra accordingly.

## BOM

For one ligra, you will need ruffly the following parts.
***
* 1 Lens (Canon FD works great here)
  * Low f-number is preferable (\<f4.0 ideally)
  * Variable focal legth preferred (70-210mm works great for me, 28-80mm is nice for smaller rooms)
  * Full manual control is a must
  * Generally, the higher the focal legth, the farther away you can project something
* A matching (back-)lenscap
* A set of 3D prints to hold the lens in place ([see 3D prints](#3d-prints))
  * 1x [FD-cap to cage-mount](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/fd_back_conn.stl)
  * 1x Supporting FD-front-cage
    * [e.g. for 70-210mm](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/fd_frontcage_70_210.stl)
    * [e.g. for 28-80mm](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/fd_frontcage_28_80.stl)
***
* A light source
  * Can be a flashlight, a LED with a lens or anything that outputs a narrow and uniform (10-15Â°) beam of light
  * I use [a cheap 3W PAR spotlight](https://www.ebay.de/itm/314966001859) (yes it says 30W, but it consumes about 3W)
* A set of 3D prints to hold the light source in place ([see 3D prints](#3d-prints))
***
* 4x [20x20mm aluminium extrusions](https://www.motedis.com/en/Profile-20x20-B-type-slot-6)
  * 400mm length works great for most lenses
  * 300mm length works for 28-80mm lenses, but is a tight fit
* 16x nuts + bolts for said extrusions (likely M4 or M5)
***
* Optionally a set of 3D prints to hold the stencil in place ([see 3D prints](#3d-prints))
  * 1x [Stencil stage](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/stencil_stage.stl)
  * 1x [Stencil rotor](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/stencil_rotor.stl)
  * 1x [Stencil counter-top](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/stencil_counter_top.stl)
  * A whole bunch of [Stencil-cages]() [FIXME]
  * A whole bunch of 3mm diameter, 2mm height disc-magnets
  * 4x ballbearings with 4mm inner diameter, 9mm outer diameter and 3-4mm height
***
* Optionally (1 front-PCB as blind)[https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/tree/main/ligra_front]
  * 4x M5x16mm screws
  * 4x M5 washer
  * 4x [3D printed endcaps](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/end_cap.stl)
***
* Optionally (1 back-PCB to drive the light source)[https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/tree/main/ligra_back]
  * 4x M5x16mm screws
  * 4x [3D printed endcaps](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/end_cap.stl)
  * 4x [3D printed feet](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/foot.stl)
***
* Optionally a [3D print](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/tripod_plate.stl) for a tripod to attach to
  * 4x sets of nuts + bolts for the extrusions
***
* Optionally a tripod

## 3D prints

[WIP]

## Required Tools

* Hex-drivers (or whichever screwhead you choose)
* M5 tapping kit
* 3D printer, FDM, SLA or SLS will do
* Exactor knife (for cleaning up 3D prints)
* Optionally a 2D printer for printing out stencils
  * See [Projection-Media](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/projection-media.md)
