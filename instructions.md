This document shall serve as a comprehenive assembly-manual. Feel free to diverge at any point to build the ligra you want.

## Preface

This guide assumes that you are building the same ligra as I did, I will try to make it clear, when something is either optional or specific to my hardware/your hardware. All in all I want to show you, how you can design your own projector, Gobo, light-graffiti, art-, whatever-light-machine. I want to show you, how you can bring a lens, a light source and something image forming together to crate something that allows you to be creative.

## Planning

[WIP]

## BOM

For one ligra, you will need ruffly the following parts.
***
* 1 Lens (Canon FD works great here)
  * Low f-number is preferable (\<f4.0 ideally)
  * Variable focal legth preferred (70-210mm works great for me, 28-80mm is nice for smaller rooms)
  * Full manual control is a must
  * Generally, the higher the focal legth, the farther away you can project something
* A matching (back-)lenscap
* A set of 3D prints to hold the lens in place ([see 3D prints](#3d-prints))
  * 1x [FD-cap to cage-mount](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/fd_back_conn.stl)
  * 1x Supporting FD-front-cage
    * [e.g. for 70-210mm](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/fd_frontcage_70_210.stl)
    * [e.g. for 28-80mm](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/fd_frontcage_28_80.stl)
***
* A light source
  * Can be a flashlight, a LED with a lens or anything that outputs a narrow and uniform (10-15Â°) beam of light
  * I use [a cheap 3W PAR spotlight](https://www.ebay.de/itm/314966001859) (yes it says 30W, but it consumes about 3W)
* A set of 3D prints to hold the light source in place ([see 3D prints](#3d-prints))
***
* 4x [20x20mm aluminium extrusions](https://www.motedis.com/en/Profile-20x20-B-type-slot-6)
  * 400mm length works great for most lenses
  * 300mm length works for 28-80mm lenses, but is a tight fit
* 16x nuts + bolts for said extrusions (likely M4 or M5)
***
* Optionally a set of 3D prints to hold the stencil in place ([see 3D prints](#3d-prints))
  * 1x [Stencil stage](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/stencil_stage.stl)
  * 1x [Stencil rotor](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/stencil_rotor.stl)
  * 1x [Stencil counter-top](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/stencil_counter_top.stl)
  * A whole bunch of [Stencil-cages]() [FIXME]
  * A whole bunch of 3mm diameter, 2mm height disc-magnets
  * 4x ballbearings with 4mm inner diameter, 9mm outer diameter and 3-4mm height
***
* Optionally (1 front-PCB as blind)[https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/tree/main/ligra_front]
  * 4x M5x16mm screws
  * 4x M5 washer
  * 4x [3D printed endcaps](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/end_cap.stl)
***
* Optionally (1 back-PCB to drive the light source)[https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/tree/main/ligra_back]
  * 4x M5x16mm screws
  * 4x [3D printed endcaps](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/end_cap.stl)
  * 4x [3D printed feet](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/foot.stl)
***
* Optionally a [3D print](https://github.com/Jana-Marie/ligra/blob/main/CAD/stls/tripod_plate.stl) for a tripod to attach to
  * 4x sets of nuts + bolts for the extrusions
