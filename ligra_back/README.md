# Back-Board

This board serves as power-input and LED controller for a 0-3A 0-5V LED. It currently is v1.0.0 and has an additional DC-motor speed controller onboard, you can safely ignore it. I plan to build a different version for myself, that is a bit more advanced, feel free to then also use it. Generally this board is fully optional, but may prove to be very useful.
